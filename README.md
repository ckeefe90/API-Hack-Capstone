# Find Me a Recipe

## Summary

This is a recipe searching app that will give up to 10 random results. The user can use one personalization or all 4 options. This app allows the user to search through a wide variety of recipes with some personalization if interested. If the user wants to learn more about any recipe they can select "Get Ingredients" where a dropdown will appear listing all ingredients for that recipe along with a link to the source URL, taking the user directly to that site if clicked on.

At this point the app requires an API key be entered in order for it to be functional. I will update the application as I learn back end so the user is not required to enter an API key for functionality.
